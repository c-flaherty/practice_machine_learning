## SimpleFeedfowardNeuralNet_IRISDataset.py
In this algorithm, I implement a neural network on the classic IRIS dataset. Following the architecture outlined in TTIC 31230: Fundamentals of Deep Learning, Lecture 2, the network consists of: 1 hidden layer, softmax activation functions, Cross-Entropy Loss, Stochastic Gradient Descent. In all the times that I train and ran it, it exhibited an accuracy >90%.
